## Groundwater Data Manipulation and Analysis Using R

Three different types of groundwater data is available for analysis;
Water quality
Water-levels
Abstraction rates
Data was provided in Excel format (multi sheets), in spread and wide format, some data gaps existed and other was not available.
R was used to first manipulate the data, and establish an understanding of data dimension and structure, and then analyze the data and present it in different forms as in the following section (discussion and results)

## Plotting (stored in figures folder)
Water quality data was manipulated and analyzed then plots were created 
Water-level data was plotted in many different ways
Abstraction data was also manipulated and then plotted 

## Future steps

The basic idea was to establish the relationship between over abstractions and water-level decline and water quality deterioration.
The second issue is trying to build a prediction related to the relationship between these three components.
Unfortunately, time wise, I was not able to build that kind of relationship I thought of initially, if I got the opportunity I think
I'll be able to do it
